## Introduction

Isomorphic applications, also known as Universal JavaScript applications are JavaScript applications that preload data using server-side rendering before running on the application on the client-side. This ensures that all content is available for crawlers and other bots to index.

This repository holds the code for an isomorphic pet adoption website, built Nuxt and Node. 

Run the `backend` and `frontend` folders seperately to test it.
